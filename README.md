# StrikeWinstreaks
A StrikePractice winstreaks addon with MongoDB database support
## Purposes
This addon was originally made for Crackpixel, but then I decided to open source it to fill up my portfolio and prove that I have the balls to do anything.
## Pull Requests
You think the code quality is top-tier garbage? Feel free to open a pull request. I'm open about my code quality, just don't contact me on anywhere to bash about my code, instead make a pull request.
